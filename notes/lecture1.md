# LESSON 1. GETTING STARTED 

### Demo: is it a bird?

- import libraries
- load images of birds (_all models need numbers as their inputs. Images are already stored as numbers in a computer. [PixSpy](https://pixspy.com/)_)
- load images of _not birds_ (can't really search that, so we're going to search for forest and birds)
  - resize them
  - check for broken one
- create a **DataBlock** (gives fast.ai all the information it needs to create a computer vision model)
- learn

### Where are we now with DL?

- it moves extremely fast
- DALL-E, midjourney
- Google Pathway language model (PaLM)

### introduction to DL 

- the ML approach: designing features
- the DL approach: the network build the feature for us, we ask it to learn features
  - the network creates the feature itself
  - the deeper you get, the more sophisticated features you find
